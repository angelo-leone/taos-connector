# TAOS connector

**[Talent Augmentation OS (TAOS)](https://taoshq.com)** is a personalised AI coaching layer for the AI you already use. It speeds you up where you are strong, coaches you where you are growing, and keeps the skills you care about from quietly atrophying under AI use.

This repository is a **connector only**. It points your AI client at the hosted TAOS service. The assessment engine, the coaching layer, and your profile all live server-side. There is nothing to configure and nothing proprietary here.

## Install

**Claude Code**

```
claude mcp add taos --transport http https://taoshq.com/mcp
```

**Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, or any MCP-aware client**

Add a custom connector pointing at:

```
https://taoshq.com/mcp
```

Authentication is Google OAuth, handled by your client on first connect.

## After connecting

Ask your assistant: **"Run my TAOS assessment."**

Or build your profile on the web at [taoshq.com](https://taoshq.com).

## How it works

TAOS rates your expertise per domain, then matches each task to the right mode: accelerate your expert work, coach your growth areas, protect skills at risk, or hand judgement calls back to you. Your profile is portable and follows you across AI vendors.
